## Description

This app is an employee tracker, the user is able to view all employees in the database by name, department or manager. Other functionality includes, updating or adding employees, updating managers and removing employees.

Constructing this assignment, I created a custom database using mySQL. Using mySQL is showing me the importance of organizing the data very specifically in order to operate smoothly when running the JavaScript page.

When setting up the index.js file, I noticed patterns in the construction and how to efficiently store data based on users actions in the different functions.

## Usage

This app can be used to track and manage employess in the database from the command line

## Features

My employee tracker uses mySql to hole all the data, and Inquirer to send questions to the command line
